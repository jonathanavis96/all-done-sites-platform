## How THUNK Works

**Purpose:** Permanent append-only log of all completed tasks from workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

**Key Concepts:**

- **THUNK #** = Globally sequential number (never resets, always increments)
- **Original #** = Task number from workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (e.g., "1.1", "T5.3")
- **Era** = Logical grouping of tasks from a plan phase

**Auto-Append Behavior:**

- When you mark a task `[x]` in workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, `thunk_ralph_tasks.sh` detects it
- Task is automatically appended to workers/ralph/THUNK.md with next sequential THUNK #
- Duplicate prevention: Tasks are matched by description to avoid re-adding

**Monitor Integration:**

- `current_ralph_tasks.sh` - Shows only uncompleted `[ ]` tasks
- `thunk_ralph_tasks.sh` - Shows completed tasks from this file

**Hotkeys in thunk_ralph_tasks.sh:**

- `[r]` - Refresh display (clears screen, re-reads THUNK.md)
- `[f]` - Force sync (scan workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for new completions)
- `[e]` - Start new era (prompts for name)
- `[q]` - Quit monitor

## Notes

- This file is append-only; never delete entries
- Display can be cleared with `[r]` hotkey, but log persists
- Each project gets independent THUNK numbering (starts at 1)
- When starting a new plan phase, use `[e]` to create a new Era section
